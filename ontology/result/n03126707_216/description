The image shows a white Mitsubishi Canter truck with a yellow crane mounted on the back. The truck appears to be parked in a construction or industrial area, with buildings and trees visible in the background.

The truck has a flatbed cargo area and the crane is folded up, not in use. The crane has "CB2900" printed on its arm in black text.

The truck's cab has a slightly worn or dirty appearance, suggesting it is a working vehicle. The license plate is partially visible but I cannot make out the full number.

In the background, there are gray industrial or warehouse style buildings. Green trees are also visible, indicating the area has some vegetation around the structures.

The ground surface the truck is parked on looks like gravel or crushed rock, typical of a construction site or industrial yard. Some orange construction cones or markers are visible on the ground near the truck.

Overall, the image depicts a commercial crane truck in what appears to be its typical working environment - a construction or industrial site with the truck temporarily parked and the crane stowed while not in active use at the moment the photo was taken.
