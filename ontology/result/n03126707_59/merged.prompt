  "system": "Please merge the two following JSONs for image recognition. \nThey are two bottom-up constructions of features that add up to recognize images.\n\n- Remove any node that are speculative, or are interpretations not directly seen in the image (for instance remove \"allows pivoting\" or \"impressive\")\n- Each node must be visible on its own and answer the question \"can this be seen in this image\"\n- Each node is composed of other visible features that adds up to compose it\n- Keep the JSON compact, discard unimportant features and move too specific ones to lower level nodes\n\nFor instance, instead of\n\n\"warning lights\": {\n  \"on outriggers\": {}\n}\n\nyou want\n\n\"warning lights on outriggers\": {\n  \"warning lights\": {},\n  \"outriggers\": {}\n}\nBecause \"warning lights\" is a visible feature of an image, so is \"warning lights on outriggers\", and to see \"warning lights on outriggers\", one need to first detect \"warning lights\" and \"outriggers\".\n\nBe sure to incorporate all features from both JSON into a top-level crane node.
